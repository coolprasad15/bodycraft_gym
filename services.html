      <p>Cardiovascular fitness is a component of physical fitness, which refers to a person's ability to deliver oxygen to the working muscles, including the heart. Cardiovascular fitness is improved by sustained physical activity (see also endurance training) and is affected by many physiological parameters, including cardiac output (determined by heart rate multiplied by stroke volume), vascular patency, and maximal oxygen consumption.</p>

      <p>Functional strength training is a fitness approach designed to enhance the body's ability to perform everyday movements with ease and efficiency. Unlike traditional strength training that isolates specific muscle groups, functional training focuses on exercises that mimic real-life activities, such as lifting, squatting, and climbing. By engaging multiple muscles and joints simultaneously, functional strength training aims to improve overall body coordination, stability, and strength. Core exercises like squats, lunges, push-ups, and planks are commonly used, as well as tools like kettlebells, resistance bands, and medicine balls.</p>

      <h3>Nutrition Guidance</h3>
      <img src="public/home/diet.jpg" alt="Nutrition Guidance">
      <p>Nutrition is the biochemical and physiological process by which an organism uses food and water to support its life. The intake of these substances provides organisms with nutrients (divided into macro- and micro-) which can be metabolized to create energy and chemical structures; too much or too little of an essential nutrient can cause malnutrition. Nutritional science, the study of nutrition as a hard science, typically emphasizes human nutrition.</p>

      <p>A personal trainer is an individual who creates and delivers safe and effective exercise programs for healthy individuals and groups, or those with medical clearance to exercise. They motivate clients by collaborating to set goals, providing meaningful feedback, and by being a reliable source for accountability. Trainers also conduct a variety of assessments beginning with a preparticipation health-screening and may also include assessments of posture and movement, flexibility, balance, core function, cardio-respiratory fitness, muscular fitness, body composition, and skill-related parameters (e.g. power, agility, coordination, speed, and reactivity) to observe and gather relevant information needed to develop an effective exercise program and support client goal attainment.</p>
