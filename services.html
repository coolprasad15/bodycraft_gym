      <img src="public/home/cardio.jpg" alt="Cardio & Endurance">

      <h3>Functional Training</h3>
      <img src="public/home/functional.jpg" alt="Functional Training">
      <p>Functional training in the gym involves exercises that mimic everyday movements to improve strength, balance, and coordination for daily tasks, rather than isolating individual muscles like traditional weightlifting. It focuses on compound movements like squats, lunges, pushes, and pulls, often using equipment such as kettlebells and medicine balls to build overall fitness, reduce injury risk, and enhance quality of life for all fitness levels.</p>

      <h3>Weight Lifting</h3>
      <img src="public/home/weight.jpg" alt="Weight Lifting">
      <p>Weightlifting training in a gym is a type of strength training that uses external resistance, such as barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, or weight machines, to build muscle strength, endurance, and size. The goal is to force the body to adapt to heavier loads, leading to stronger and more muscular development, which improves overall health and functional fitness.</p>

      <h3>Yoga Training</h3>
      <img src="public/home/yoga.jpg" alt="Yoga Training">
      <p>"Yoga in gym" refers to practicing yoga within a gym environment, where dedicated classes may be offered, or individuals may use yoga techniques for warm-ups, flexibility, and cool-downs alongside traditional gym equipment and workouts. While yoga's essence is a holistic mind-body discipline, within a gym context, it's often utilized for its physical benefits like improved strength, balance, and flexibility, complementing other fitness activities.</p>
